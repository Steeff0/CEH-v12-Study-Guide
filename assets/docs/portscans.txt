#Port scans and how they work

What does the port status Open mean | The remote host sends a response to accept the connection.
What does the port status Closed mean | The remote host sends a response indicating the connection is denied.
What does the port status Filtered mean | There is no reply from the remote host.

What are the characteristiscs of a TCP SYN/half-open/stealth scan | half-open scanning as it doesn’t connect completely to the port
What are the characteristiscs of a Connect or Vanilla scan | sends the connect() system call. Is faster than other scans, but more easily detected
What are the characteristiscs of a UDP scan | UDP packet to every port in the scope of the scan but is Slow.
What are the characteristiscs of a ICMP scan | not a port scan, but it is used to check if the host is up.
What are the characteristiscs of a FIN scan | sends a FIN packet. No response from the target port means the port is open or blocked by a firewall. Hence, this scan isn’t very effective.
What are the characteristiscs of a XMAS scan | sends a FIN & URG & PUSH packet. Same response as FIN. Easily detected.
What are the characteristiscs of a NULL scan | sends a packet with no flags. Same response as FIN.
What are the characteristiscs of a TCP ACK scan | Sends ACK packet that checkes if the port is filtered (detect the presence of a firewall).
What are the characteristiscs of a Idle/zombie scan | TCP SYN scan with spoofed IP of other machine and uses this machine to detect if port is open. Anonymous.
What are the characteristiscs of a FTP bounce scan | Uses a FTP server as middle man for the scan. Anonymous, but slow and often disabled on the FTP server.
What are the characteristiscs of a Fragmented scan | Fragment the packet. Bypass packet filters but slow.
What are the characteristiscs of a Strobe scan | Strobe scan is more focused scan where an attacker scans for the known port to exploit.
What are the characteristiscs of a Windows scan | Same as TCP ACK scan, but can also detect open ports by the windows size. Hard to detect, minimum traffic, but doesn't work on all devices.
What are the characteristiscs of a Service fingerprint scan | Sends data to detect the service.

In a TCP SYN scan what returns an OPEN port? | SYN/ACK

In a Connect or Vanilla scan what returns an OPEN port? | SYN/ACK
In a Connect or Vanilla scan what returns an CLOSED port? | RST
In a UDP scan what returns an OPEN port? | No Response
In a UDP scan what returns an CLOSED port? | ICMP error
In a FIN scan what returns an OPEN port? | No Response
In a FIN scan what returns an CLOSED port? | RST
In a XMAS scan what returns an OPEN port? | No Response
In a XMAS scan what returns an CLOSED port? | RST
In a NULL scan what returns an OPEN port? | No Response
In a NULL scan what returns an CLOSED port? | RST
In a TCP ACK scan what returns an FILTERED port? | ICMP Error or No Response
In a TCP ACK scan what returns an UNFILTERED port? | RST
In a ZOMBIE scan what returns an OPEN port? | IPID + 2
In a ZOMBIE scan what returns an CLOSED port? | IPID + 1
In a FTP BOUNCE scan what returns an OPEN port? | Transefer complete
In a FTP BOUNCE scan what returns an CLOSED port? | Can't build data connection
In a WINDOW scan what returns an OPEN port? | RST with non-zero window size
In a WINDOW scan what returns an CLOSED port? | RST with non-zero window size
In a WINDOW scan what returns an FILTERED port? | ICMP Error or No Response
